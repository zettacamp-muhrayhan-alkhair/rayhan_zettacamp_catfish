                  Ray Charles Robinson(born September 23, 1930 in Albany, Georgia, U.S.) was an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. He is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential singers in history, and was often referred to
                  by contemporaries as "The Genius". Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called "Brother Ray". Charles was blinded during childhood, possibly due to glaucoma.
