        <h2>Rex Orange County</h2>
        <p>Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3>2014-2016: Early career and Bcos U Will Never B Free</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          At age 16, O'Connor picked up the guitar and started to produce his own music using Apple's Logic software. At this age, he also began attending the BRIT School where he studied drumming and was one of four percussionists in his
          year; the relative rareness of his primary instrument provided him with wide exposure to various projects of others in his school which he credits to exposing him to new and fresh music.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          On 4 September 2015, O'Connor self-released his debut album Bcos U Will Never B Free on SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Upon listening to the album, fellow English musician and producer Two Inch Punch got in touch with O'Connor,
          providing him with a management team. The two have continued to collaborate throughout O'Connor's career in the form of the tracks "UNO", "Best Friend", and "Untitled". The album also caught the attention of American rapper Tyler,
          the Creator, who sent O'Connor an email describing his enjoyment of the project. This led to him flying O'Connor out the following year to L.A. to collaborate on his then-upcoming album Flower Boy,[11] with O'Connor co-writing and
          contributing vocals to the songs "Boredom" and "Foreword". On 17 November 2016, O'Connor released the single “UNO”, a song Clash magazine described by writing, "The buoyant keyboard riff underpins a hypnotic half-spoken vocal, one
          that veers from topic to topic in a hazy burst of creative mania."On 25 January 2017, O'Connor released the single “Best Friend” (premiering on Apple Music's Beats 1 station), followed later in the year by the release of his
          second album Apricot Princess. O'Connor's work has been compared to "other artsy, post-genre teen artists".
        </p>
        <h3>2017-present: Apricot Princess, Pony, and Who Cares?</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          O'Connor's first release following the success of Apricot Princess and Flower Boy was on 11 October 2017 with the single "Loving Is Easy", created in collaboration with the Dutch artist Benny Sings. On 16 April 2018, O'Connor
          performed the song in his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On 31 May 2018, O'Connor released a cover of "You've Got a Friend in Me" in collaboration with Randy Newman, the creator of the song. He was
          also featured in Spotify's Rise Program.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          On 9 October 2018, O'Connor was scheduled to appear on the French television programme Quotidien, but refused to perform because it featured a sketch by comedian Alison Wheeler parodying the Ku Klux Klan, which he called
          "tasteless".
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          On 14 February 2019, O'Connor released the single "New House". Later that year on 12 September, O'Connor released "10/10"; the lead single from his third album Pony. Released on 25 October 2019, Pony was O'Connor's first
          major-label album release through RCA Records. The album received a lukewarm reaction among critics, with Pitchfork rating it a 5.0 out of 10. Associate Editor Anna Gaca described the album as "relentlessly juvenile" while
          criticising its more "childlike" sound relative to his previous releases.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          On 30 September 2020, O'Connor released an EP with recordings from his performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City during his Pony tour titled Live at Radio City Music Hall alongside a documentary released on YouTube.
          This documentary showed the events leading up to this performance as well as the early conclusion of the Pony tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          In October 2020, O'Connor confirmed that he was in the process of recording a fourth studio album titled Who Cares?. In January 2021, he liked a Tweet seemingly confirming that it would be released at some point later that year.
          However, this did not materialise. On 13 January 2022, O'Connor began officially teasing the album, sending out postcards containing a phone number that when called, a snippet of song would play. The song, titled "Keep It Up" was
          released as a single on 26 January 2022. Along with this, it was announced on O'Connor's Instagram that 'Who Cares?' would be released on 11 March 2022.
